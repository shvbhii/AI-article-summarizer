## üöÄ About This Project

This project is **Day 20** of my **#30DaysOfVibeCoding** challenge.

After building a real-time application on Day 19, the "vibe" for today was to dive into the world of AI integration and tackle a practical, real-world problem. This project demonstrates a complete, full-stack workflow: scraping content from the web, processing it through a powerful AI model via an API, and presenting the result in a clean, user-friendly interface.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **AI-Powered Summarization:** Leverages the high-speed Groq API with the Llama 3 model to generate accurate and readable summaries.
-   **Full-Stack Architecture:** A robust Node.js/Express backend handles all business logic, ensuring the frontend remains fast and responsive.
-   **Intelligent Web Scraping:** The backend fetches the article from the provided URL and uses Cheerio to parse the HTML and extract its core text content.
-   **Polished User Experience:** The interface provides clear loading and error states to keep the user informed throughout the process.
-   **Modern & Responsive UI:** A clean, visually appealing design that works flawlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
-   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
-   **Core Libraries:**
    -   `axios`: For making HTTP requests to fetch article HTML.
    -   `cheerio`: For efficient server-side web scraping.
    -   `groq-sdk`: The official SDK for interacting with the Groq AI API.
    -   `dotenv`: For secure management of environment variables (like the API key).
-   **Deployment:** Render

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

To run this project locally, you will need a free Groq API key.

1.  **Get your API Key:**
    -   Visit [GroqCloud](https://console.groq.com/keys) and sign up for a free account.
    -   Create a new API key and copy it.

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/shvbhii/AI-article-summarizer.git
    ```
3.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
    ```
4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
5.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root of the project and add your API key:
    ```
    GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_YourActualGroqApiKeyGoesHere
    ```
6.  **Start the server:**
    ```sh
    node server.js
    ```
7.  Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## ü§ñ The Role of AI

As part of the #30DaysOfVibeCoding challenge, I'm transparent about how AI played a role. For this project, AI acted as an expert consultant on API integration:

-   **Backend Logic:** Provided the boilerplate for using `axios` and `cheerio` in tandem to effectively scrape and clean article text.
-   **Prompt Engineering:** Suggested the optimal "system prompt" to instruct the Llama 3 model to produce concise, high-quality summaries.
